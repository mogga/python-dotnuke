# "gizmos" Directory

# **WARNING**

Hopefully you already understand that any gizmos here will probably be
outside of the scope of any studio pipeline as their in the user workspace.

This really is for convenience only and gizmos created here should be deleted
from scripts or risk not being renderable.
